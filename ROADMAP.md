## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Basic Security Camera)  
Focus on building the fundamental features required for a security camera application.  

- [x] Implement real-time video feed using OpenCV  
- [x] Add motion detection with OpenCV  
- [x] Implement snapshot capture on motion detection  
- [x] Enable video recording with playback support  
- [ ] Display timestamps on recorded videos  
- [x] Provide a basic GUI using Tkinter

## Phase 2: User Customization & Enhancements  
Improve user experience with customization options and settings.  

- [ ] Create a settings panel for adjustable sensitivity (motion detection)  
- [ ] Implement adjustable resolution & frame rate settings  
- [ ] Add toggle options for enabling/disabling recording  
- [ ] Implement multi-camera support for multiple webcam feeds  

---

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Features  
Enhance security capabilities with AI-powered detection.  

- [ ] Integrate face/person detection using OpenCV or TensorFlow  
- [ ] Implement object classification (detect specific items, pets, etc.)  
- [ ] Enable AI-powered anomaly detection for unusual activity  

---

##  Phase 4: Alerts & Notifications  
Ensure real-time alerts and accessibility for users.  

- [ ] Implement sound alerts when motion is detected  
- [ ] Add email or push notifications for detected motion  
- [ ] Provide cloud storage integration (Google Drive, AWS, etc.)  

---

##  Phase 5: Performance & Optimization  
Optimize for better performance, stability, and lower resource usage.  

- [ ] Optimize CPU/GPU usage for smooth video processing  
- [ ] Implement background running mode with minimal resource consumption  
- [ ] Improve storage management (automatic deletion of old recordings)  

---

##  Phase 6: Deployment & Community Contributions  
Prepare for public release and encourage collaboration.  

- [ ] Write proper documentation for setup and usage  
- [ ] Publish the first stable version on GitHub  
- [ ] Gather user feedback and iterate based on improvements  
- [ ] Enable plugin/extension support for future features
